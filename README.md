# AudioMaster Bot üéµ

## Description üìù

Hello! I am the AudioMaster bot üëã. Designed to extract audio from videos available on YouTube and other video hosting services, I can handle videos up to 40 minutes long and allow you to upload your own videos for audio extraction.

üéâ *Convenience:* Often, music found in videos may not be available on popular audio streaming platforms. AudioMaster fills this gap by providing an easy way to extract and listen to these unique tracks.

üö´ *YouTube Limitations:* Listening to videos in the background on YouTube requires a Premium subscription. Without it, you're forced to keep the YouTube app open, draining your device's battery and using data.

üí° *Our Solution:* With AudioMaster, you can save money, time, and battery life. Extract the audio from videos and enjoy listening in the background, hassle-free, without the need for a Premium subscription.

This bot is written in Python üêç and utilizes the `telebot` library for Telegram interaction and `moviepy` for audio extraction from videos.

üöß **Please note:** I am still in development, so some features may be unstable. We are constantly working on improving the bot.

>[!IMPORTANT]
